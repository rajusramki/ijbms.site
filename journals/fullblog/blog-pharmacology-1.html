                                                or as monotherapy.</p>

                                            <p>Cardiovascular disease, or coronary heart disease, is the number one cause of death in both men and women in the developed countries.<sup>1</sup> Atherosclerosis remains a major cause
                                                of cardiovascular diseases. High concentrations of total cholesterol (T.C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL – C), and triglyceride (TG), and low levels of high density
                                                lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL – C), are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, making the identification and management of hyperlipidaemia in patients at risk
                                                of future vascular events a priority.<sup>2-4</sup></p>
                                            <p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with a two to three-fold risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD)<sup> 5</sup> and a doubling of CHD events post-myocardial infarction.
                                                CHD is the leading cause of death in patients with Type 2 DM,<sup>6</sup> wherein factors such as increased total cholesterol, increased LDL-cholesterol, haemoglobinA<sub>1c</sub>                                                                            hypertension, retinopathy, smoking and albuminuria have all been shown to increase cardiovascular event rates in diabetic patients.<sup>7</sup></p>
                                            <p>Recently, diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease were categorized as being at very high risk, which prompted even more aggressive targets for one major modifiable risk factor-the
                                                plasma concentration of LDL-C.<sup>8</sup></p>
                                            <p>The current mainstay of medical treatment of hyperlipidemia is the administration of hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors. The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors
                                                block cholesterol synthesis in the liver, resulting in the increased uptake of serum LDL cholesterol. This results in predictable and dose-related decrements in serum LDL cholesterol.
                                                Side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort, liver toxicity, and myopathy. <sup>9, 10</sup> Currently the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors that are in use are Atorvastatin, Simvastatin,
                                                Lovastatin, and Rosuvastatin.</p>
                                            <p>Despite the efficacy of statins in lowering Low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) levels, many patients for heart disease with hypercholesterolemia require additional LDL – C level reduction.
                                                A new cholesterol absorption inhibitor, Ezetimibe, is the first agent of a new class of lipid-lowering compounds that selectively inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol
                                                and related phytosterols, which received US Food and Drug Administration approval in October 2002 and was launched in U.K.<sup> 11</sup> It is licensed for the treatment of primary
                                                hypercholesterolemia either for co-administration with a statin or as monotherapy. In clinical trials,  Ezetimibe produced significant reductions in LDL – cholesterol both alone
                                                and when added to statin therapy.<sup>12</sup></p>

                                                <p>CVD events are four times more common in individuals with diabetes, occur at a younger age, and have a much greater case fatality rate.<sup>13</sup> The risk of CVD conferred by diabetes
                                                    is so great that the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III identifies diabetes as a CVD risk equivalent—a condition that requires aggressive
                                                    care to prevent future vascular events in people with known vascular disease.<sup>14</sup> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported that 70–97% of individuals
                                                    with diabetes have dyslipidemia.<sup>15</sup> While therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management, the inclusion of patients with diabetes
                                                    in the high-risk category and the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients has been well established.<sup>8</sup></p>
                                                <p>The present study compared the lipid-lowering efficacy of Atorvostatin alone and when added with the novel drug Ezetimibe in Type II Diabetes Mellitus patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.
                                                    Both the drugs were given after a dietary run in period of 2 weeks, during which the participant did not take any drugs or cholesterol supplements that could have an effect on
                                                    the lipid parameters.</p>
                                                <p>It is well established that statins exhibit most of their LDL–Cholesterol reducing effects within 2 weeks and produce full effects by 4 to 6 weeks.<sup> 39, 40 </sup>Despite their
                                                    established efficacy, however, studies have noted that the number of patients who are able to attain and maintain LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels recommended by the US National
                                                    Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) <sup>14 </sup>is suboptimal, which indicates a gap between lipid goals and clinical practice.<sup>16</sup> Statin
                                                    doses often are not titrated to achieve goals. The ACCESS study reported that about 72% of the patients with CHD achieved the ATP II goal at a maximum titration (up to 80 mg).<sup>17</sup>                                                                            However, maximum dosages of atorvastatins has been associated with increased incidence of elevated liver enzymes, hepatotoxicity and myalgias.<sup>18</sup> These findings necessitate
                                                    the need of an adjuvant drug that can effectively add up to the actions of the statins while reducing the dosage required and bringing about the best possible attainment of the
                                                    NCEP goals.</p>
                                                <p>Our study indicated a 30.1% higher reduction in the LDL-C levels when both Atorvostatin and Ezetimibe were administered. This greater reduction of LDL–C resulted in a higher percentage
                                                    of participants who achieved their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) goals. The efficacy was 71.2% higher in relation to HDL-C levels with the combination treatment.
                                                    Further, a 40.1% higher reduction in the total cholesterol levels were noted the AtvEz group showing greater efficacy of the combination in reducing total cholesterol levels.
                                                    Similarly, a 49.3% higher reduction in the triglyceride levels was noted in the combination group.</p>
                                                <p>There are several double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that have investigated the efficacy of ezetimibe co-administered with a statin when compared with statin therapy alone in
                                                    patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia.</p>
                                                <p>An 8 week trial which consisted of 769 patients taking stable doses of atorvastatin (10 to 80 mg daily), simvastatin (10 to 80 mg daily), lovastatin (10 to 40 mg daily) fluvastatin
                                                    (20 to 80 mg daily), pravastatin (10 to 40 mg daily) or cerivastatin (0.2 to 0.8 mg daily) noted that co-administering ezetimibe 10 mg daily in these patients significantly reduced
                                                    LDL-C levels when compared with statins and a placebo (25.1% vs 3.7%, p&lt;0.001).<sup>12</sup></p>
                                                <p>Three other 12 week trials randomized patients to different doses of a statin either alone or in combination with ezetimibe 10 mg daily. One of the trials which comprised of 668 patients
                                                    reported a significant reduction in LDL-C than simvastatin alone (49.9% vs 36.1%, p&lt;0.01) when compared to ezetimibe plus simvastatin 10 to 80 mg daily.<sup>19</sup></p>
                                                <p>Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg daily was evaluated in another trial with 628 participants. Here it was noted that the combination therapy reduced LDL-C by 54.5% when compared
                                                    with 42.4% for atorvastatin alone (p&lt;0.01). Further, the combination provided additional triglyceride reductions of 30% to 40%, and HDL-C increases of 5% to 9%, were also noted
                                                    depending on atorvastatin dose when used alone.<sup>20</sup></p>
                                                <p>From the same trial, 246 patients were enrolled in a 12-month extension to study the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe in combination with atorvastatin and comparing it with atorvastatin
                                                    alone. After 6 weeks, the combination therapy produced greater reductions in LDL-C (-53 vs. -37%), TC (-38.8 vs. -26.0%) and TG (-28 vs. -12%) compared to monotherapy. Further,
                                                    these changes were maintained and significant at 1 year (p &lt; 0.01 for LDL-C, TC and TG). <sup>21</sup></p>
                                                <p>The third 12 week trial (n=538) compared the efficacy of ezetimibe plus pravastatin 10 to 40 mg daily and reported a significantly higher reduction in LDL-C than with pravastatin
                                                    alone (37.7% vs 24.3%, p&lt;0.01).<sup>22</sup></p>
                                                <p>The combination therapy was well tolerated in our study wherein a total of 3 patients withdrew due to adverse effects. The adverse effects included gastritis (in both groups) and
                                                    pain in the thighs (in the AtvEz group) which subsided following withdrawal of the treatment. Several studies have reported that the safety, tolerability and incidence of liver
                                                    and muscle adverse experiences of the combination therapy are similar to atorvastatin alone. <sup>20, 23-25 </sup>A long term (12 months) study by Ballantyne et al also reported

                                                    hence there may be psychological effect on the outcome which cannot be confirmed. The outcomes were dependent upon the patient compliance which was recorded based on the number
                                                    of tablets left in the strips at each visit. Thereby absolute compliance could not be predicted.  <strong><br />CONCLUSION</strong></p>
                                                <p>The 8 week combination drug therapy (Atorvostatin 10mg with Ezetimibe 10mg, daily) was noted to be more effective than monotherapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with primary
                                                    hypercholesterolemia. The combination therapy was more effective than statin alone in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia. Ezetimibe plus statin
                                                    was well tolerated and had a similar safety profile in both the groups. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy should be considered for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients
