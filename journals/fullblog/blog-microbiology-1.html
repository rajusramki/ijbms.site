                                        <p>Novel flu is a new influenza caused by quadruple reassortment virus, that is it has 2 genes from flu viruses circulating in pigs in Europe and Asia, bird genes and human genes.<sup>1</sup></p>
                                        <p>The first case emerged in Mexico on April 15 2009, then it spread leading to a global pandemic and WHO raised the pandemic alert to phase 6 on June 11 2009.<sup>2</sup> In India a
                                            total of 15411 cases have been reported of which 523 died .In Karnataka a total of 1530 cases have been reported of which 118 died(as on 15<sup>th </sup>November.)<sup>3 </sup></p>
                                        <p>The information analyzed by CDC (Center for Disease control) supported the conclusion that novel H1N1 flu caused greater disease burden on people younger than 25 years than older
                                            people.<sup>4</sup>The symptoms are similar to seasonal flu although vomiting and diarrhea has been reported more commonly with H1N1.<sup>4 </sup>The number of deaths is also
                                            higher in 25-49 years of age.<sup>4</sup></p>
                                        <p>In India initially surveillance was started at airports and then extended to community level. In order to make the testing facility more accessible at large and due to onset of flu
                                            season in the country, it was decided to revise the guidelines. Thus persons presenting with flu like symptoms were categorized into category A (Patients with mild fever plus
                                            cough / sore throat with or without body ache, headache, diarrhea and vomiting) category B(in addition to signs and symptoms of category A if the patient has high grade fever
                                            and severe sore throat or having one or more of the following high risk conditions like children less than 5 years old, pregnant women persons aged 65 years or older, patients

                                            and category C(In addition to the above signs and symptoms of Category-A and B, if the patient has breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, fall in blood pressure, irritability
                                            among small children, refusal to accept feed, worsening of underlying chronic conditions).<sup> 5 </sup>Testing is done only for category C and pharmacological treatment given
                                            for category B and C.<sup>5</sup></p>

                                            we decided to do a study of profile of the patients admitted with novel flu in these two hospitals from June till November 15<sup>th</sup> . By studying the profile of the patients
                                            we will come to know the common age group, symptoms, underlying medical condition and treatment outcome thus helping us in better management of the future cases</p>

                                        <p>The study was conducted in the two largest government set ups of Karnataka. After few cases of novel flu were reported these two hospitals were identified initially for screening
                                            and treatment for novel flu, then later other centers were identified. After obtaining permission from the directors of these two institutions information regarding  common clinical
                                            features, underlying medical condition and treatment outcome of the patients admitted with novel flu in the two set ups from June till November 15<sup>th</sup>(a total of 112
                                            patients) was collected by record analysis. It is a hospital based study.</p>

                                        <p>The study revealed that out of 112 patients 32.1% of the admitted patients were in the age group of 26-35 years,17% less than 15 years and 3.6% of the patients were in the age group
                                            of 56-65 years.61.6% were males and 38.4% were female (refer table 1).</p>
                                        <p>The study revealed that 38.6% of the patients presented after two days of symptoms and 27.7% after more than six days (refer table 2 ). 83% presented with fever,72.3% presented with
                                            cough, 33.03% with breathlessness and 18.75% with sore throat (refer table 3).</p>
                                        <p>The study revealed that 17% of the patients had history of travel to novel flu affected areas, 6.3% history of contact with novel flu cases and 6.3% had history of both travel and
                                            contact. While in the patients admitted before mid September 31.7% of the patients had history of travel to novel flu affected areas,11.7% had history of contact with novel flu
                                            cases,11.7% had both travel and contact history. Thus demonstrating the presence of disease in the community (History of contact-patients had been in contact with a case of novel

                                        <p>The study   revealed that for majority of patients (51.7%) the duration of stay in the hospital was 4-6 days (refer table 5).</p>
                                        <p>12 patients (10.7%) had history of underlying comorbid conditions like diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), HIV etc

                                        <p class="lead"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
                                        <p>The study revealed that most of the patients was in the age group of 16-35 years and the median age was 27 years. While in a study done in California hospitalization rates were highest
                                            for young adults ages 18 to 29 and lower for older people and the median age was 27 years.<sup>7</sup> The study revealed that 17% of the patients were less than 15 years while
                                            a study in Mexico showed 41.9% of patients were aged less than 15 years.<sup>8</sup> This is in contrast to peak periods of seasonal influenza, when influenza hospitalizations
                                            are more common among persons 65 years of age or older and those under the age of 5 years.<sup>9</sup> The study revealed almost half the hospitalizations involved persons under
                                            the age of 35 years and only 0.9% were more than 55 years of age. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include the fact that children are more likely to be exposed in schools,
                                            the young have a greater susceptibility to the virus (as compared with persons &gt;60 years of age) and young febrile patients are more likely to be tested, since older adults
                                            with influenza often do not have fever.<sup>10</sup> In the study 10.7% had history of underlying comorbid conditions while a study in California showed 64% had underlying medical
                                            conditions.<sup>11</sup>The most common symptoms in the study patients were fever, cough, and breathlessness this is similar to the findings of a study done in California.<sup>11</sup>The
                                            study revealed that 19 patients(16.9%) were treated with steroids, similar study done in United States showed 36% received such drugs.<sup>10</sup>The study revealed that 31 patients
                                            (27.6 %) admitted in ICU(intensive care unit) and were in age group of 16-35 years, this is similar to findings of a study done in United States which revealed that 25% of the
                                            patients were admitted to an ICU and the median age of those who were admitted to an ICU was 29 years.<sup>10</sup></p>
                                        <p>In this study out of 112 admitted patients 26 (23.2%) died while in a study done in California of the 1088 hospitalization, 118 were deaths, which translates into a fatality rate
                                            of 11 per cent.<sup> 7</sup> The higher number of deaths reported in the study may due to the change in criteria for admission which recommended admission for only seriously ill
                                            patients. The study revealed that for patients older than 50 years the mortality rate was 19.1% which is similar to a study in California which showed that for people age 50 and
                                            older, the fatality rate was as high as 20 per cent.<sup>7 </sup>This study revealed that the most common cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome which is similar
                                            to a study done in California where the most common causes of death were viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are complications of influenza.<sup> 7 </sup>Most
                                            of the patients who died were in the age group of 16 -35 which is similar to the previous study which showed persons age 20–40 accounted for the bulk of the excess deaths.<sup>12</sup></p>
                                        <p><strong>Conclusion : </strong> The study that demonstrated that novel flu (H1N1) infection-related critical illness predominantly affects young patients with few major comorbid conditions and is associated
                                            with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, often requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Although serologic studies suggest that influenza A (H1N1) is a novel influenza strain
                                            with little protection afforded by seasonal influenza vaccination, adults older than 60 years appear to have some preexisting immunity to this novel virus. Fever and respiratory
                                            symptoms were harbingers of disease in almost all cases. Most of the patients who died were more likely to have higher severity of illness at presentation and greater organ dysfunction</p>
                                        <p><strong>Conflict of interest :</strong> none</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The drugs commonly used prior to anaesthesia are opiates, benzodiazepines, atropine and phenothiazines. Phenothiazines use is associated with salivary suppression, antiemesis and amnesia
                                            but it caused muscle tremors, restlessness, postop pallor and delayed recovery from anaesthesia. Incidence of restlessness & dizziness is more with benzodiazipines but advantage is that it does not delay the recovery and is often followed by a period of amnesia and provides post-op comfort. Belladona alkaloids have been used in anaesthesia for many centuries. Out of these, atropine is most widely used. Though belladona drugs can be used orally, the oral use of atropine is not much in vogue. It is usually admitted by s.c, i.m, i.v routes, though it is
                                            completely absorbed from gatrointestinal tract (small intestine). The gastrointestinal absorption of atropine has also been studied and observed that atropine sulphate is completely ionised upto pH of 7.5 & poorly lipid soluble, High alkalanity of duodenum and small intestine favour rapid absorption. Oral atropine has been used as premedication in children and found to be as effective as atropine given parenterally.</p>

                                        <p>Inhalation of halothane, N 0, and O is the most common method of inducing GA in paediatric patients, but incidence of bradycardia and myocardial depression is almost a consistent finding
                                            in dose related fashion. Because the ventricles of young infant’s heart are not so compliant and the cardiac output is highly dependent on H.R. Blood pressure depends on both C.O. & S.V.R. Infants require increased alveolar concentration of halothane to block the response to a surgical stimulus; thus more prone to cardiovascular depression effects of halothane. Keeping all these points in mind, we need to have a premedicant that can attenuate this cardiovascular depression during halothane anaesthesia. Atropine administration supports cardiac output by increasing H.R. and supports B.P. by maintaining cardiac output. Its antisialagogue and antiemetic actions help in reducing the secretions of saliva & mucous from respiratory tract & prevent post-op nausea & vomiting, thus allowing smooth induction, maintenance & recovery from anaesthesia.</p>
